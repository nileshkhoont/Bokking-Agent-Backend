"""The functions Edesy's agent invokes *while on the call* (folder-structure doc). Secured by
`core.tool_auth.require_tool_secret` — a shared secret, not an admin JWT, since Edesy's servers
call these directly with no admin session in play.

`identify_person` is one addition beyond the folder-structure doc's original four tools
(`check_slot_availability`, `book_appointment`, `reschedule_appointment`,
`log_callback_request`): the documented inbound-call flow requires the agent to identify the
caller and learn whether they already have an appointment (PDF §2.1) before it can decide which
branch to take, and no other tool covers that — so it's a necessary part of the documented
architecture, not an invented feature.

    data — this is what actually enforces "an appointment can only be reached from the phone
    number the current call is really with", not just prompt wording.

    For an OUTBOUND call, edesy_call_id (Edesy's own {{call.sid}} call-context token — never an
    LLM-fillable parameter, same as phone_number is meant to be) is looked up against
    call_schedules, which was written by OUR OWN dispatch code
    (workers/tasks/outbound_call_task.py) the moment we placed the call — before Edesy, the LLM,
    or the person on the other end of the line were ever involved. When a match exists, THAT
    schedule's person is used and payload.phone_number is not consulted at all. This is
    deliberate: if a caller says "cancel my friend's appointment, his number is ...", or if a
    dashboard's Request Body ever mistakenly exposes phone_number as something the model can
    fill in, it still cannot change whose appointment gets looked up, rescheduled, or cancelled
    on an outbound call — the schedule fixes that before the call starts.

    Falls back to phone_number-based lookup otherwise. That fallback is the ONLY path available
    for INBOUND calls: Edesy's platform only ever fires one webhook, call.ended, AFTER the call
    is already over (see integrations/edesy/webhook_events.py) — there is no call.started
    signal, so nothing exists server-side to independently verify an inbound caller's number
    against before the call happens. phone_number there is Edesy's own {{call.phone_number}}
    call-context token, resolved by Edesy's telephony layer from the real caller ID — trusted the
    same way it always has been, which is why it is critical that every tool's Request Body in
    the Edesy dashboard maps phone_number to that token and does NOT list it as an LLM-fillable
    parameter (see the prompt-update guidance delivered alongside this change).

    overwrite_existing_name: False for identify_person specifically (see its own call site) —
    2026-09-23 incident: a caller asked to check a FRIEND's appointment and stated the friend's
    name; the model passed that name straight through as full_name. Because identity here always
    resolves to the CALLER's own real phone number/schedule (exactly as designed above), that
    silently renamed the caller's own record to the friend's name — and identify_person's
    response then echoed that new name straight back, making the model believe it actually WAS
    looking at the friend's data, compounding the confusion for the rest of the call. A brand
    new Person has no existing name to protect, so full_name is still used to seed one on first
    contact either way — only an UPDATE to an already-known name is ever skipped.
