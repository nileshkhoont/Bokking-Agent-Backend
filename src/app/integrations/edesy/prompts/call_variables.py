"""Per-call template variables sent alongside `context` on outbound `place_call` requests, for
Vani's dashboard-level `{{variable}}` prompt substitution (Agent editor -> Agent Instructions ->
Variables). Whether Vani's real API field for this is named `variables` is inferred from the
dashboard calling the feature "Variables" — not confirmed against real documentation, since none
is available (see integrations/edesy/schemas.py's EdesyPlaceCallRequest docstring). Verify with a
real outbound call once credits allow, by checking whether the agent actually speaks the caller's
name/appointment details instead of a literal "{{person_name}}".

The upcoming/expired decision is computed here, in UTC-aware Python, rather than left to the LLM —
language models have no reliable notion of "today's date" mid-conversation, so doing date math in
the prompt would be guesswork. This mirrors render_admin_instructions_context's approach of
pre-rendering call-specific text server-side instead of asking the agent to derive it.

These pre-call variables only ever describe ONE appointment — the one Step 0 opens with — because
they are plain string substitution, computed before the call starts and before any tool has run.
A person can have several upcoming appointments (see appointment_repository.list_upcoming_for_
person); the full list, with real appointment_ids the agent can act on, is deliberately NOT sent
here. It's fetched live via the identify_person tool call instead, so it can never go stale
between when this call was scheduled and when it's actually answered, and so the agent has one
single source of truth for "which appointments exist" and "which id is which" throughout the
call, the same way Step 3C's cancellation flow already works.
